# Introduction (about B4A)

When it comes to mobile development and specifically **Android** there are many developer tools out there, starting from the official **Android Studio** (which uses Java the official development language for **Android**) to more or less cross-platform solutions like Xamarin (with C#), NativeScript, Smartface, TabrisJS, React Native (all of these make use of JavaScript language).

There are also different development approaches when it comes to development, like hybrid(using Cordova) or native(using C/C++ or Java). 

**B4A** is a simple to use and powerful **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** from Anywhere Software, capable of building completely native **Android** applications. 
It is easy to grasp for beginners and fully loaded with a lot of features necessary for experienced developers. It uses a **Basic (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)** dialect similar to **Visual Basic** (VB6, VB.Net).

Combined with **B4i** (which is another **RAD** tool from Anywhere Software) you can share most of the logic code between **And**roid and **iOS** projects.

**B4A** it is used the thousands of developers all around the world for small inhouse applications to _real world commercial applications_.

#### Who is this guide for


#### What you beed to run B4A

**B4A** development tool is available only for **Windows**. In order to use it, you will need a PC running Windows (I recommend Window 7) with at least 2Gb of RAM.

You can test your app on either an emulator (a virtual device running on your PC) or a real device. We recommend you have a real device available as it usually takes less time to install your app there than on an emulator and apps running there usually execute faster.

If you use a real device it should be running Android 1.6 or above (that is Android 2.x, 3.x etc.).
